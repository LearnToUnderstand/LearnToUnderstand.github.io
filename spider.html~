                <h1> SPIDERS </h1>
		<p> Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing <span id='s1'></span>
 that 
have <span id='s2'></span> legs and fangs that inject <span id='s3'></span>. They are the 
largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity 
among all other orders of organisms. </p>

<p>Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for <span id='s4'></span>, 
and have become established in nearly every 
habitat with the exceptions of air and sea. </p>

<p>As of November 2015, at least 45,700 spider species, and 113 families have 
been <span id='s5'></span> by taxonomists. However, there has been disagreement 
within the scientific community as to how all these families should be 
<span id='s6'></span>, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications 
that have been proposed since 1900. </p>
<p> Anatomically, spiders differ from other arthropods in that the usual body 
segments are fused into two <span id='s7'></span>, the <span id='s8'></span>
 and <span id='s9'></span>, and joined by a small, <span id='s10'></span> <span
id='s11'></span>.  Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae.</p>
<p>   As there is so much to say about spiders, the bottom line is:  spiders are awesome.
The help keep the annoying bug population down, and ones like the Brazilian Wandering 
and the Bold Jumping Spiders are what make this world so fantastically <span id='s12'>
</span>. </p>

<!--  NOTES:      

*   when hover over HELP, make help list show (like menu, z-index: 3)
*  single list style
*  don't do "noun".  instead request "thing", "person", etc...
  after more skill, you can take the adjective, verb, color, etc... 
    and apply it to other stories??  one list of words, 
    tried out in different stories??  That would be unique! 
*  these should be converted into a loop
store all answers in an array?  that way we'll have the 
index # of each answer.  (will it work?)

original section; kept getting writer's block  
                <p> There once was a little 
                <span id = "s1"></span> 
                spider that was born into this world to live a under the big 
                <span id = "s2"></span> sky.  Being abandoned at a young age, 
		the spider spent its days searching for food and constantly 
		re-building its home. </p>
                <p> It was a kind and generous spider.  It never bothered anybody 
		and always stayed out of the way when others were around. </p>
     <span id = "s3"></span>  It found its place at the corner of a house

  what's the css to capitalize the first letter, again?  
                and got along very well, very quickly.  They became BFFs in no
                time!</p>
