        <h2>Why People Switch to Linux</h2>
        <p>
          Linux is a modern operating system that can make older computers feel new again and give you more control over
          how your device works. It’s used everywhere—from home PCs to servers—and it has grown a lot in ease of use.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed &amp; performance:</strong> Many Linux setups run fast, especially on older hardware.</li>
          <li><strong>Customization:</strong> You can choose how the desktop looks and behaves (simple or advanced).</li>
          <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Linux is known for being reliable and running smoothly.</li>
          <li><strong>Security:</strong> Strong security model and frequent updates.</li>
          <li><strong>App choices:</strong> Huge selection of free software, plus web apps and many popular tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Most Linux distributions are free to use.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is Linux Easy to Use?</h2>
        <p>
          For most everyday tasks—web browsing, email, streaming, documents, and basic photo work—Linux can be very easy.
          The experience depends on the “distribution” (version) you choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          A beginner-friendly choice usually means:
          <strong>a familiar desktop</strong>, <strong>easy updates</strong>, and <strong>a software store</strong> for apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Linux may take a little adjustment if you rely on specific Windows-only programs. In many cases there are good
          alternatives, web versions, or compatibility options depending on your needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Great Reasons Linux Can Be a Smart Move</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Your PC feels slow</strong> and you want better performance without buying a new device.</li>
          <li><strong>You want fewer popups</strong> and more control over updates and settings.</li>
          <li><strong>You mainly use the web</strong> (browser-based work, email, streaming, cloud documents).</li>
          <li><strong>You like learning</strong> and want a system that rewards curiosity and customization.</li>
        </ul>
