# LearnToUnderstand.github.io

This is my first website, showcasing my love for Madlibs, comedy and computer programming.  
It's pretty self-explanatory, but you supply various words, and the JavaScript inserts them into a story,
with the intention of creating a hilarious story and a fun time with friends (or solo).




My computer science journey began with HTML, CSS and JavaScript back in mid-2017. 
I am currently learning:
  Python
  Node.js
  AWS  (1 certificate acquired already)
  Salesforce and Apex programming
