        <h2>Quick Rules That Stop Most Scams</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Never share one-time codes</strong> (text/email verification codes) with anyone.</li>
          <li><strong>Don’t click urgent links</strong> in emails/texts—go to the site/app manually instead.</li>
          <li><strong>Don’t trust caller ID.</strong> Scammers can fake phone numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>Pause and verify.</strong> Call the company back using a number from their official website.</li>
          <li><strong>Never pay with gift cards, crypto, or wire transfer</strong> for “support,” “fees,” or “refunds.”</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If something feels rushed, threatening, or “too good to be true,” slow down. Scams depend on panic and speed.

        <h2>Common Scams &amp; Techniques</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Phishing emails</strong> — messages pretending to be from banks, delivery services, or password alerts.
            They push you to click a link and sign in.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Smishing (text phishing)</strong> — texts like “package delivery failed” or “your account is locked”
            with a suspicious link.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vishing (phone scams)</strong> — calls claiming to be your bank, Microsoft, Amazon, IRS, etc.
            They try to get personal info or payment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fake tech support popups</strong> — scary browser popups saying you have a virus and must call a number.
            Real security alerts do not demand phone calls.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Remote access scams</strong> — they convince you to install remote tools and then “show problems”
            or steal passwords/files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Password reset / MFA code theft</strong> — they ask for your login code “to verify it’s you.”
            That code lets them take over your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Refund scams</strong> — they claim you’re owed a refund, then “accidentally” send too much and ask you
            to send money back (or they use fake bank screens).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overpayment scams</strong> — common with selling items online. They “pay extra,” then ask you to refund
            the difference. Their original payment later bounces.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Romance scams</strong> — someone builds trust over time and then asks for money, gift cards, or crypto.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Job/remote work scams</strong> — fake hiring, fake checks, or asking you to buy equipment and “get reimbursed.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investment/crypto scams</strong> — guaranteed returns, “insider” tips, or fake trading platforms.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Impersonation scams</strong> — pretending to be your friend/family member who “lost their phone” and needs money fast.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Red Flags (If You See These, Stop)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Pressure: “Act now,” “last chance,” “you’ll be arrested,” “your account will be closed today.”</li>
          <li>Payment methods: gift cards, crypto, wire transfer, or “pay by QR code.”</li>
          <li>Requests for: passwords, one-time codes, or remote access.</li>
          <li>Links that look “almost right” (misspellings, extra words, strange domains).</li>
          <li>Sender addresses that don’t match the company (even if the email looks official).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What To Do If You Think You’re Being Scammed</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Stop communicating.</strong> Don’t click more links or continue the call/chat.</li>
          <li><strong>Disconnect remote access immediately</strong> (turn off Wi-Fi / unplug ethernet) if someone got in.</li>
          <li><strong>Change passwords</strong> (starting with email), and enable <strong>multi-factor authentication</strong> where possible.</li>
          <li><strong>Check your accounts</strong> (bank, credit card, email, social) for unusual activity.</li>
          <li><strong>Contact your bank/card provider</strong> if money was sent or card details were shared.</li>
          <li><strong>Run a security scan</strong> and remove suspicious apps/extensions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you’re not sure what happened, it’s okay to ask for help. The goal is to limit damage quickly.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Safer Habits (Simple Prevention)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a <strong>password manager</strong> and unique passwords for important accounts.</li>
          <li>Turn on <strong>MFA</strong> (authenticator app is better than SMS when available).</li>
          <li>Keep your device and browser <strong>updated</strong>.</li>
          <li>Install apps only from official stores and trusted vendors.</li>
          <li>Be cautious with browser extensions — fewer is safer.</li>
        </ul>
