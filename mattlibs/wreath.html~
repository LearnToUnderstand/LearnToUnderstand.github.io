                <h1 id = 'wreathh1'>HOW TO MAKE A WREATH : </h1>
                <p>First, you have to choose your <span id = 'w1'></span>.  This 
                includes the theme, colors, <span id = 'w2'></span> and 
                add-ons.</p>
                <p> You'll need about <span id = 'w3'></span> rolls of ribbon, 
                per wreath.  </p>  
                <p> Acceessories may come in many different shapes, sizes and colors.  
                They also vary greatly in texture (some can be as rough as <span id = 'w4'>
                </span> !) and stiffness (some are soft and some are as stiff as 
                thin <span id = w5></span> ). </p>  Then you measure, cut and 
                <span id = 'w6'></span> ) .  You'll be doing a lot of measuring 
                and cutting, so plan to be there a while, and prepare a 
                <span id = 'w7'></span> before you sit down.  You'll definitely 
                want to have a large area to work with.  It would be 
                <span id = 'w8'></span> working in a space like a <span id = 'w9'>
                </span>.
                Once you do a few practice wreaths, you'll be selling them in no 
                time.  You can charge anywhere between $<span id = 'w10'></span> 
                and $<span id = 'w11'></span> for each wreath.  When you're all 
                done, you can show it to the world and shout <span id = 'w12'></span> !!
