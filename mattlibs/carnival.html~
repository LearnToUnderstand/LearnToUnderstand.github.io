        <h1> The Day At The Carnival! </h1>
        <p> We went to the Carnival yesterday.  
To be honest, it was pretty <span id='w1'></span>.  
You pay a lot of money, compared to the value 
that you get from the rides and <span id = 'w2'></span>.  
The employees mostly seemed like they didn't 
care about you one bit, and they didn't really 
convince me that they love what they do.  
The rides make you wonder how good the 
maintenance staff is, when you look at the 
condition of the machines.  

Of course, everybody loves the carnival food, 
if you want to call it food.  
I wonder how disguisted I'd be if I were to research 
the nutritional information.  Do you think that 
the employees eat that stuff all the time?

It was very crowded, and the rides were crappy.  
The house of mirrors took about two minutes to get through, 
and the fastest rides made me want to fall asleep.  
The whole thing costed me 3 hours of my life and $60 
of my hard earned money.  While we were there we 
got in line for two different rides that happened to 
break down after we'd been waiting for over 10 minutes.  

The bumper cars seemed like they were going to fall 
apart any minute, and the sledge hammer game hit the 
bell at the top even when a 8 year old girl swung it!  
Not to mention the water pistol games had no accuracy 
whatsoever, while the fish bowl pingpong ball game 
made you wonder what tricks they were playing on you...

In short, I would not recommend traveling carnivals 
to a friend, and I can't believe that so many people 
still love those things.  Don't say I didn't warn you!

<!-- don't do "noun".  instead request "thing", "person", etc...
  after more skill, you can take the adjective, verb, color, etc... and apply it to other stories??  one list of words, tried out in different stories??  That would be unique!  -->
