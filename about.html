        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Love Life. I’m an entry-level IT professional with a strong customer service background and a
          <strong>CompTIA A+</strong> certification. I enjoy troubleshooting, learning new technology, and helping
          people feel comfortable with their devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m building experience through hands-on practice, home lab learning, and real-world problem solving.
          My goal is to join a team where I can grow into a skilled help desk / IT support technician while continuing
          to provide great service to clients who need reliable tech help.
        </p>
